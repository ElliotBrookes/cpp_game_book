# Game Book Code

The two books that these two folders are based off are:

- Game programming in C++ - Sanjay Madhav
-   - held in game dir
- Multiplayer game programming - Joshua Glazer & Sanjay Madhav
-   - held in multi_game dir

## Running the code

see the Makefiles in game & multi_game. Each make command builds and runs
a corresponding portion/breakpoint of the code (by chapter or different proj
as directed in the books)

to run the final version of the code just run ```make``` and the default target will be built and executed
